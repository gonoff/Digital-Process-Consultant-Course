## Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop a comprehensive automation strategy for TechFlow Solutions that maximizes ROI within budget constraints while addressing their specific technical and organizational limitations.

**Duration**: 4-6 hours  
**Deliverable**: Professional automation strategy document (2 pages) suitable for executive presentation

## Company Profile: TechFlow Solutions

**Business Context**:
TechFlow Solutions provides IT support and custom software development for mid-market companies across the Pacific Northwest. Founded in 2018, they've grown from 8 to 45 employees and generated $3.2M revenue in 2023.

**Current Process Volumes**:
- **Service Tickets**: 450 monthly (8 minutes average handling time)
- **Project Proposals**: 180 monthly (25 minutes each for pricing calculations)
- **Client Billing Entries**: 1,200 monthly (3 minutes each data entry time)

**Technology Environment**:
- **ServiceNow**: Modern ticketing system with robust REST APIs, implemented 2022
- **QuickBooks Desktop**: Version 2019, limited integration capabilities, contains all client billing data
- **Custom Pricing Spreadsheet**: Complex Excel workbook with macros, used for project cost calculations
- **Office 365**: Complete suite including Power Platform licensing
- **Internal Network**: Windows Server 2019, hybrid cloud/on-premise setup

**Team & Resources**:
- **IT Team**: 2 full-time staff (1 senior, 1 junior) with basic PowerShell/Python scripting experience
- **Finance Team**: 3 staff members spending 15+ hours monthly on manual data entry
- **Project Managers**: 4 PMs spending 12+ hours monthly on proposal calculations
- **Monthly Automation Budget**: $1,500 maximum
- **Implementation Timeline**: Must show measurable ROI within 12 months

**Business Constraints**:
- Cannot upgrade QuickBooks to cloud version due to existing integrations
- Pricing spreadsheet contains proprietary formulas that cannot be fully replicated in other systems
- ServiceNow was recently implemented; staff are still learning the platform
- High client service standards require 99.5% uptime for critical processes

## Current Process Analysis

### Process 1: Service Ticket Management
**Manual Steps**:
1. Initial ticket review and categorization (2 minutes)
2. Client data lookup and enrichment (3 minutes)
3. SLA assignment and priority setting (1.5 minutes)
4. Notification sending to appropriate technician (1.5 minutes)

**Pain Points**:
- Inconsistent categorization leads to missed SLAs
- Manual client data lookup causes delays
- 15% of tickets assigned to wrong technician initially

### Process 2: Project Proposal Creation
**Manual Steps**:
1. Gather requirements from client meeting notes (8 minutes)
2. Input project parameters into Excel pricing model (12 minutes)
3. Format proposal document and add boilerplate content (5 minutes)

**Pain Points**:
- Pricing calculations prone to formula errors (8% error rate)
- Proposal formatting takes excessive time
- No version control on pricing changes

### Process 3: Client Billing Entry
**Manual Steps**:
1. Extract time entries from project management system (1 minute)
2. Cross-reference with client billing rates (1 minute)
3. Manual entry into QuickBooks Desktop (1 minute)

**Pain Points**:
- Double data entry between systems
- Billing delays impact cash flow
- Reconciliation errors require additional staff time

## Assignment Requirements

Create a professional automation strategy document addressing the following sections:

### Section 1: Process Prioritization & ROI Analysis
**Requirements**:
- Calculate current monthly cost for each process (labor hours Ã— hourly rates)
- Estimate potential time savings from automation (be realistic, not optimistic)
- Rank processes by ROI potential and implementation complexity
- Show break-even timeline for each recommended automation

**Calculation Guidelines**:
- Use $65/hour for senior IT staff time
- Use $45/hour for finance/PM staff time
- Account for 80% automation efficiency (not 100%)
- Include ongoing maintenance costs in ROI calculations

### Section 2: Tool Recommendations with Justification
**Requirements**:
- Recommend specific automation tools for each prioritized process
- Justify tool selection based on technical constraints and capabilities
- Provide pricing breakdown with monthly and annual costs
- Address integration challenges and mitigation strategies

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Technical compatibility with existing systems
- Learning curve for current staff capabilities
- Scalability as TechFlow continues growing
- Total cost of ownership over 24 months

### Section 3: Implementation Timeline & Resource Plan
**Requirements**:
- Create realistic 12-month implementation timeline
- Identify resource requirements and skills gaps
- Define success metrics and measurement methods
- Include risk mitigation for critical business processes

**Timeline Considerations**:
- Staff availability during busy seasons (Q4 and Q1)
- Testing periods to ensure process reliability
- Training time for team members
- Parallel running periods before full cutover

### Section 4: Risk Assessment & Success Metrics
**Requirements**:
- Identify top 5 implementation risks with mitigation strategies
- Define specific, measurable success criteria
- Establish monitoring and maintenance protocols
- Plan for scaling automation as business grows

**Risk Categories to Address**:
- Technical integration failures
- Staff resistance to process changes
- Client service disruptions during implementation
- Budget overruns or timeline delays

## Deliverable Specifications

**Format**: Professional business document (PDF preferred)
**Length**: 2 pages maximum (executive summary style)
**Visual Elements**: Include at least one chart or table showing ROI projections
**Tone**: Confident but realistic, suitable for executive review

**Document Structure**:
1. **Executive Summary** (3-4 sentences)
2. **Process Prioritization & ROI** (0.5 pages)
3. **Tool Recommendations** (0.5 pages)
4. **Implementation Plan** (0.5 pages)
5. **Risk Assessment** (0.5 pages)
