## Sample Solution: TechFlow Automation Strategy

### Executive Summary

TechFlow Solutions can achieve $47,200 annual savings through strategic automation of three core processes. Priority focus on service ticket management using Microsoft Power Automate provides fastest ROI (3.2 months) while leveraging existing Office 365 licensing. Phased 12-month implementation minimizes disruption while building internal automation capabilities.

## Section 1: Process Prioritization & ROI Analysis

### Current Process Costs

**Service Ticket Management**:
- Volume: 450 tickets Ã— 8 minutes = 3,600 minutes monthly
- Cost: 60 hours Ã— $65/hour = $3,900/month ($46,800 annually)
- Error Impact: 15% misrouting Ã— 2 hours rework = $195/month additional cost

**Project Proposal Creation**:
- Volume: 180 proposals Ã— 25 minutes = 4,500 minutes monthly  
- Cost: 75 hours Ã— $45/hour = $3,375/month ($40,500 annually)
- Error Impact: 8% pricing errors Ã— 3 hours rework = $108/month additional cost

**Client Billing Entry**:
- Volume: 1,200 entries Ã— 3 minutes = 3,600 minutes monthly
- Cost: 60 hours Ã— $45/hour = $2,700/month ($32,400 annually)
- No significant error costs (simple data entry)

### Automation Potential & ROI Projections

| Process | Monthly Savings | Tool Recommendation | Setup Cost | Monthly Cost | Break-Even |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Service Tickets | $3,120 (80% efficiency) | Power Automate | $2,500 | $150 | 3.2 months |
| Project Proposals | $2,430 (72% efficiency) | Power Automate + Excel API | $4,000 | $200 | 5.5 months |
| Billing Entry | $2,025 (75% efficiency) | Custom Scripts + ODBC | $8,000 | $100 | 11.2 months |

**Priority Ranking**:
1. **Service Tickets** - Highest savings, fastest ROI, leverages existing systems
2. **Project Proposals** - Medium complexity, significant time savings
3. **Billing Entry** - Longest payback but addresses cash flow improvement

## Section 2: Tool Recommendations with Justification

### Primary Recommendation: Microsoft Power Automate

**Rationale**:
- Already licensed through Office 365 subscription
- Native ServiceNow connector available
- Strong Excel integration for proposal calculations
- 2-person IT team can manage with existing skills
- Robust error handling and monitoring capabilities

**Technical Implementation**:

**Service Ticket Automation**:
- ServiceNow webhook triggers on new ticket creation
- Power Automate flow enriches ticket with client data from SharePoint list
- Automated categorization using keyword matching
- SLA assignment based on client tier and issue type
- Teams notification to appropriate technician with ticket summary

**Project Proposal Enhancement**:
- Trigger from SharePoint document library (meeting notes upload)
- Extract requirements using AI Builder text recognition
- Power Automate Desktop to interact with Excel pricing model
- Generate formatted proposal using Word template
- Email workflow for review and approval

### Alternative Considerations

**Zapier Professional ($60/month for required task volume)**:
- **Pros**: Easier setup, better ServiceNow integration
- **Cons**: Additional monthly cost, limited Excel automation capabilities
- **Verdict**: Not cost-effective given existing Power Platform licensing

**Custom Python Scripts**:
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, lowest ongoing costs
- **Cons**: Requires hiring developer or extensive training
- **Verdict**: Consider for billing integration after proving automation value

## Section 4: Risk Assessment & Success Metrics

### Top 5 Implementation Risks & Mitigation

**1. ServiceNow Integration Failure**
- **Risk**: API connectivity issues or webhook unreliability
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing in sandbox environment, fallback manual processes
- **Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**2. Excel Pricing Model Complexity**
- **Risk**: Automation unable to handle all pricing scenarios
- **Mitigation**: Phased rollout starting with standard proposals only
- **Probability**: High | **Impact**: Medium

**3. Staff Resistance to Process Changes** 
- **Risk**: PMs and support staff resist automated workflows
- **Mitigation**: Involve key users in design process, emphasize value-add focus
- **Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium
