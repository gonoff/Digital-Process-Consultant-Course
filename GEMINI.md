# Gemini Project Context: AI-Powered Digital Process Consultant Course

This file contains essential context about the "AI-Powered Digital Process Consultant Mastery Course" project to ensure consistent and informed assistance.

## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Goal**: To provide a comprehensive, self-paced course for a learner named "Haniel" to become a digital process consultant for US-based SMEs.
- **Status**: The course is 100% complete, including 5 levels, a capstone project, and a narrative companion series ("The Haniel Chronicles"). My role is to assist with analyzing, modifying, or extending this existing material.
- **Primary Persona**: The course is designed for "Haniel". The content should be approached with this persona in mind.

## 2. Content and Structure

- **Architecture**: The course is divided into 5 levels (0-4) and a final Capstone project.
- **Chapter Structure**: Each chapter within a level consistently contains four types of files:
    - `LX_CY_reading.md`: Core theory, scenarios, and tool demonstrations.
    - `LX_CY_quiz.html`: Interactive, self-contained HTML/CSS/JS quiz.
    - `LX_CY_project.md`: A practical project to build a portfolio artifact.
    - `LX_CY_solutions.md`: A guide with sample work and evaluation rubrics.
- **File Naming**: Follows the `LX_CY_[type].format` convention (e.g., `L2_C1_reading.md`).
- **Bilingual Requirement**: All content is in English (US context) first, with a corresponding Portuguese translation. Technical terms and US business context must be preserved in the translation.

## 3. Technical & Style Guidelines

- **Navigation**: The project uses Obsidian-style wiki links (`[[file|display text]]`) for navigation between course files. All files should include the standard top and bottom navigation blocks.
- **Diagrams**: Use Mermaid syntax embedded in markdown code blocks for process maps (BPMN) and diagrams whenever possible.
- **Tone & Voice**:
    - **Professional & Practical**: Concise, skeptical, avoids hype.
    - **Second Person**: Address the learner as "you".
    - **Data-Driven**: Use specific, real-world examples and metrics (e.g., "$12K/year savings").
- **Core Methodologies**: The course covers Systems Thinking, SIPOC, BPMN, Lean (8 Wastes, 5S), Six Sigma (DMAIC), automation (RPA, Zapier, n8n), and consulting frameworks.

## 4. My Role & Interaction

- **Assume Completion**: I will assume the course content is complete as per the `COURSE_PROGRESS_LOG.md`.
- **Maintain Conventions**: When modifying or adding content, I must strictly adhere to the established structure, file naming, navigation patterns, and tone.
- **Analyze First**: Before making changes, I will analyze the surrounding files and the course blueprint (`ai_powered_digital_process_consultant_course_blueprint.md`) to ensure consistency.
