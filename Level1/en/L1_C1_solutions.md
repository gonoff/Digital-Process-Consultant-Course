## Purpose of This Guide

This solutions guide provides sample interview analyses, evaluation frameworks, and common challenge patterns to help instructors assess student work and help students understand professional-level stakeholder interviewing standards.

## Sample Solution: Customer Service Process Interview

### Sample Pre-Interview Preparation

**Stakeholder Profile:**
Maria Rodriguez, Customer Service Representative at TechFlow Solutions, a 150-employee software company. Maria has 3 years experience handling technical support tickets and billing inquiries. Selected because she represents front-line perspective on customer complaint resolution process, which currently averages 2.3 days to resolution with 22% escalation rate. Her bilingual skills and evening shift experience provide unique insights into customer diversity and off-hours operational challenges.

**Process Context:**
The customer service process spans initial contact through resolution, involving phone, email, and chat channels. Current challenges include inconsistent response times, frequent escalations to engineering, and customer satisfaction scores declining from 4.2 to 3.6 over six months. Process matters because customer retention directly impacts recurring revenue growth. I observe this process as internal consultant hired to reduce escalation rate and improve customer satisfaction.

**Interview Objectives:**
Goals include understanding root causes of escalations, identifying gaps between official procedures and actual practice, discovering customer communication preferences, and learning about resource constraints affecting response quality. Success means gaining actionable insights for reducing escalation rate from 22% to under 15% while improving satisfaction scores. Insights will inform training program design and process workflow improvements.

### Sample Interview Execution Summary

**Pre-Interview Setup:**
Scheduled 60-minute session in Maria's workspace during slower afternoon period to minimize interruptions. Created comfortable environment by explaining confidentiality and emphasizing her expertise value. Maria initially hesitant about criticizing company processes but relaxed when assured feedback would be anonymized and used constructively. Demonstrated respect for her time by arriving prepared with specific questions.

**Key Insights Discovered:**
Most surprising revelation: Maria and colleagues deliberately avoid using official knowledge base because it's outdated and incomplete, instead relying on informal Slack channel where experienced reps share solutions. Engineering team responses vary wildly—some provide detailed explanations within hours while others take days with minimal information. Customers increasingly frustrated because they receive conflicting information when transferred between channels. Evening shift operates with limited supervisor support, leading to more conservative escalation decisions.

**Questioning Technique Analysis:**
Open-ended questions like "Walk me through your last difficult case" generated rich narratives revealing process breakdowns. Probing with "What caused that delay?" uncovered systemic issues behind surface problems. Hypothetical questions "If you could redesign one thing..." brought creative improvement ideas. Most effective approach was asking for specific examples rather than general opinions, which provided concrete evidence of process failures.

**Trust and Rapport Building:**
Established credibility by demonstrating familiarity with customer service challenges from previous roles. Used active listening—paraphrasing her concerns and asking follow-up questions about her suggestions. Acknowledged her expertise: "You handle these situations daily, so you understand customer needs better than anyone." When she mentioned frustration with management decisions, responded with "Help me understand what management might not see from their perspective."

### Sample Empathy Map

**SAYS (Direct Quotes):**
- "Customers are already frustrated when they contact us, so any delay makes it worse"
- "The knowledge base is useless—I learn more from Sara in 5 minutes than from reading docs for an hour"
- "Engineering acts like we're bothering them, but customers expect immediate answers"
- "I spend more time hunting for information than actually helping customers"
- "Night shift feels forgotten—we make decisions alone that day shift would escalate"

**THINKS (Inferred Beliefs):**
- Management doesn't understand front-line realities
- Official procedures designed by people who don't handle customers
- Good customer service requires bending rules sometimes
- Colleagues are more reliable information source than formal systems
- Personal reputation with customers matters more than company metrics

**DOES (Observable Behaviors):**
- Creates personal notes system to track customer histories
- Uses Slack channel for real-time problem-solving collaboration
- Delays escalations during night shift due to limited supervisor access
- Researches solutions during personal time to improve response quality
- Builds relationships with specific engineering contacts for faster responses

**FEELS (Emotions):**
- Frustrated by lack of reliable information resources
- Proud of customer relationships and problem-solving skills
- Anxious about escalating incorrectly and looking incompetent
- Isolated during night shift with limited support
- Motivated to help customers despite system obstacles

### Sample Insights and Recommendations

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Core issue isn't individual performance but system design that creates information silos. Knowledge base maintenance falls between departments with no clear ownership. Engineering team lacks context about customer impact of delays, leading to deprioritized support requests. Supervisor coverage gaps during off-hours force conservative escalation decisions. Previous training focused on soft skills while ignoring procedural inefficiencies that create customer frustration.

**Process Improvement Opportunities:**
Immediate wins: Update knowledge base with solutions from Slack channel, establish engineering response time SLAs with escalation triggers, create night shift supervisor coverage plan. Medium-term: Implement customer context sharing system so representatives see full interaction history across channels, establish cross-department shadowing program so engineering understands customer impact. Long-term: Redesign escalation criteria based on customer impact rather than technical complexity, create customer service career advancement path to reduce turnover.

**Implementation Considerations:**
Maria demonstrates high change readiness and would be excellent improvement champion. Key resistance point: Engineering team currently views support requests as interruptions rather than customer service opportunities. Success requires securing engineering management buy-in before announcing changes. Maria and colleagues need recognition for informal knowledge sharing that already occurs. Implementation should celebrate existing strengths while addressing system gaps that force workarounds.

## Common Student Mistakes and Guidance

### Mistake 1: Choosing Convenient Rather Than Valuable Stakeholders
**Student approach:** Interviews roommate about personal habits
**Guidance:** Select stakeholders with deep process knowledge and improvement influence. Professional settings provide richer learning opportunities and portfolio value.

### Mistake 2: Superficial Questioning Without Follow-up
**Student approach:** Asks "What problems do you have?" and accepts one-word answers
**Guidance:** Use probing questions: "Can you give me a specific example? What caused that to happen? How did that make you feel?"

### Mistake 3: Empathy Map That Merely Restates Quotes
**Student approach:** Puts same information in multiple quadrants
**Guidance:** "Says" = direct quotes, "Thinks" = beliefs not stated, "Does" = actions/behaviors, "Feels" = emotions expressed

### Mistake 4: Generic Recommendations Not Grounded in Interview
**Student approach:** Suggests standard solutions without stakeholder connection
**Guidance:** Recommendations must directly address specific issues raised by stakeholder and reflect their constraints and preferences

### Mistake 5: Poor Interview Documentation
**Student approach:** Relies on memory, provides vague summaries
**Guidance:** Take detailed notes during interview, write up within 24 hours, include specific quotes and examples

## Teaching Tips

1. **Model Interview Techniques:** Demonstrate effective questioning during class discussions. Show how probing questions reveal deeper insights.

2. **Practice Active Listening:** Have students practice paraphrasing and reflecting in pairs before conducting real interviews.

3. **Emphasize Preparation:** Stress that interview quality depends heavily on advance preparation and stakeholder research.

4. **Focus on Trust Building:** Discuss specific techniques for establishing credibility and making stakeholders comfortable sharing honest feedback.

5. **Connect to Business Impact:** Help students understand how stakeholder insights translate to process improvements and organizational value.

6. **Review Real Examples:** Share (anonymized) examples of excellent empathy maps and insight development from previous student work.

This solutions guide provides the framework for developing professional-level stakeholder interviewing capabilities essential for process improvement consulting.
