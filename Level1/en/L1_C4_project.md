## Project Overview

Design a comprehensive future state process that addresses identified root causes, develop measurable KPIs for tracking improvement success, and create realistic implementation plan with change management considerations.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Apply user-centered design principles to create practical TO-BE processes
- Balance ideal process improvement with real-world organizational constraints
- Develop comprehensive KPI frameworks using leading and lagging indicators
- Create phased implementation plans with risk mitigation strategies
- Design change management approaches that ensure stakeholder adoption

## Project Requirements

### Process Selection Criteria

This project should build on previous analysis work (stakeholder interviews, AS-IS mapping, root cause analysis) to design future state solutions:

**Ideal Project Continuity:**
- Same process analyzed in previous Level 1 assignments
- Clear root causes identified requiring systematic solution design
- Stakeholder relationships established for design validation
