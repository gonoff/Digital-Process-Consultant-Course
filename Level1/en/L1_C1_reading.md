## Learning Objectives
- Master the art of conducting effective stakeholder interviews for process improvement
- Design interview guides that uncover root causes and hidden process issues
- Apply empathy mapping techniques to understand stakeholder perspectives
- Use advanced questioning techniques to gather actionable insights
- Manage difficult conversations and overcome stakeholder resistance

## Real-World Scenario

Lisa, a process improvement consultant, was hired by Mountain View Medical Center, a 200-bed hospital struggling with patient discharge delays averaging 4.2 hours beyond physician orders. Hospital administration demanded a quick fix, claiming the problem was "lazy nurses taking too long with paperwork."

Lisa's initial data review revealed a more complex picture: discharge times varied wildly between departments (2.1 hours in cardiology vs. 7.3 hours in orthopedics), patient satisfaction scores were declining, and staff turnover had increased 35% in six months. However, the real story emerged only through careful stakeholder interviews.

During her first interview with the nursing supervisor, Lisa asked: "Walk me through what happens when you receive a discharge order." The supervisor's eyes lit up—finally, someone wanted to understand rather than blame. The conversation revealed that discharge orders often arrived incomplete, requiring nurses to hunt down physicians for missing information. Pharmacy delays meant waiting 2-3 hours for medication reconciliation. Transport services were understaffed, leaving patients waiting in beds needed for incoming admissions.

But the breakthrough came when Lisa interviewed a night-shift nurse who revealed: "We've started delaying discharges until morning shift because the day team has more resources to handle problems. Nobody told management because we thought we'd get in trouble for admitting the system doesn't work."

Lisa realized that surface-level solutions would fail without understanding the human dynamics, constraints, and workarounds that stakeholders had developed. Effective stakeholder interviewing wasn't just about gathering information—it was about building trust and uncovering the real story behind process breakdowns.

## Core Theory

### The Purpose of Stakeholder Interviews

Stakeholder interviews serve multiple critical functions in process improvement:

**Information Gathering**: Understand how work actually gets done versus how it's supposed to be done
**Problem Identification**: Uncover root causes behind process failures
**Relationship Building**: Establish trust and buy-in for improvement efforts
**Change Preparation**: Identify potential resistance and implementation challenges
**Validation**: Confirm or challenge assumptions about process performance

### Types of Stakeholders

**Primary Stakeholders**: Direct participants in the process
- Process performers (front-line workers)
- Process owners (managers responsible for outcomes)
- Internal customers (receive process outputs)
- Internal suppliers (provide process inputs)

**Secondary Stakeholders**: Indirectly affected by the process
- Senior leadership (strategic oversight)
- Support functions (IT, HR, Finance)
- External customers (if applicable)
- Regulatory bodies (compliance requirements)

**Hidden Stakeholders**: Often overlooked but critically important
- Informal leaders (respected workers who influence others)
- Subject matter experts (deep process knowledge)
- Night shift workers (different constraints and workarounds)
- Part-time staff (limited training, unique perspectives)

### Interview Planning and Preparation

**Define Interview Objectives**: Be specific about what you need to learn
- Current state process understanding
- Pain points and bottlenecks
- Workarounds and informal processes
- Ideas for improvement
- Implementation concerns

**Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify who to interview and why
- Create stakeholder influence/interest matrix
- Ensure representation from all process areas
- Include both supporters and skeptics
- Plan for 60-90 minutes per interview

**Interview Guide Development**: Structure without being rigid
- Opening (5 min): Introductions, purpose, confidentiality
- Current state (20 min): How work gets done today
- Problems (15 min): Pain points and frustrations
- Ideas (10 min): Improvement suggestions
- Future state (10 min): Vision for improvement

### Advanced Questioning Techniques

**Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage detailed responses
- "Walk me through what happens when..."
- "Tell me about a typical day in your role..."
- "Describe the last time you had to deal with..."
- "What would happen if..."

**Probing Questions**: Dig deeper into responses
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What causes that to happen?"
- "How often does that occur?"
- "What have you tried to address that?"

**Hypothetical Questions**: Explore possibilities
- "If you could change one thing about this process, what would it be?"
- "What would need to happen for this to work smoothly?"
- "If you had unlimited resources, how would you redesign this?"

**Clarifying Questions**: Ensure understanding
- "When you say 'always,' do you mean every single time?"
- "Help me understand what you mean by..."
- "Is this a recent change or has it always been this way?"

**Emotional Intelligence Questions**: Understand feelings and motivations
- "How does that make you feel?"
- "What's most frustrating about this situation?"
- "What would success look like to you?"

### The SOAR Interview Framework

**S - Situation**: Understand the context
- What is your role in this process?
- How long have you been doing this work?
- What training did you receive?
- Who do you work with most closely?

**O - Obstacles**: Identify barriers and challenges
- What prevents you from doing your job effectively?
- Where do delays typically occur?
- What resources do you lack?
- What policies or procedures create problems?

**A - Aspirations**: Explore improvement desires
- What would make your job easier?
- How would you redesign this process?
- What tools or resources would help?
- What does good performance look like?

**R - Results**: Understand outcomes and impacts
- How do you measure success?
- What happens when things go wrong?
- Who is affected by delays or errors?
- What are the consequences of current problems?

### Empathy Mapping for Stakeholders

Empathy mapping helps visualize stakeholder experiences:

**Says**: Direct quotes from interviews
- "I never have enough time to do this properly"
- "The system always crashes during busy periods"
- "Nobody asks for our input on changes"

**Thinks**: Beliefs and assumptions (not always spoken)
- "Management doesn't understand our challenges"
- "This change won't work either"
- "I could do this better if I had the right tools"

**Does**: Observable behaviors and actions
- Works overtime to meet deadlines
- Creates informal workarounds
- Avoids using certain systems or procedures

**Feels**: Emotions and feelings
- Frustrated by repetitive problems
- Proud of quality work despite obstacles
- Anxious about job security during changes

### Managing Difficult Conversations

**Resistance Patterns and Responses**:

**"We've tried that before"**
- Response: "Tell me about that experience. What worked? What didn't? How might things be different now?"

**"You don't understand our situation"**
- Response: "You're right, I don't fully understand yet. Help me learn. What am I missing?"

**"Management will never approve that"**
- Response: "What would need to change to make approval more likely? What concerns would leadership have?"

**"This is just how we've always done it"**
- Response: "That experience is valuable. What has stayed the same, and what has changed around you?"

### Building Trust and Rapport

**Confidentiality Assurance**: Be clear about information use
- Explain how interview data will be used
- Commit to anonymizing feedback
- Avoid sharing individual comments with management
- Follow through on promises

**Active Listening Techniques**:
- Maintain eye contact and open body language
- Take notes but don't let it dominate attention
- Paraphrase and reflect back what you hear
- Ask follow-up questions based on responses

**Respectful Inquiry**:
- Acknowledge expertise: "You know this process better than anyone"
- Show appreciation: "Thank you for taking time to help me understand"
- Validate concerns: "That sounds really frustrating"
- Avoid judgment: "Help me understand the reasoning behind that"

## Tool Demonstration

### Conducting a Stakeholder Interview: Step-by-Step

Let's walk through interviewing a hospital nurse about patient discharge delays:

**Step 1: Opening (5 minutes)**
"Thank you for meeting with me, Sarah. I'm Lisa, working with your administration to understand the patient discharge process. My goal is to learn how things really work so we can identify improvements that make your job easier, not harder. Everything you share will be kept confidential—I won't attribute specific comments to individuals. Do you have any questions before we start?"

**Step 2: Role and Context (10 minutes)**
- "Tell me about your role here. How long have you been working in this unit?"
- "Walk me through a typical shift. What are your main responsibilities?"
- "Who do you work with most closely during the discharge process?"

**Step 3: Current State Process (20 minutes)**
- "Let's focus on patient discharges. Walk me through what happens from the moment you receive a discharge order."
- "Take me through the last discharge you handled. What were the steps?"
- "How do you know when all discharge requirements are complete?"

**Step 4: Problems and Pain Points (15 minutes)**
- "What makes discharges challenging or frustrating?"
- "Tell me about a time when a discharge didn't go smoothly. What happened?"
- "What causes the longest delays in your experience?"
- "What do you wish other departments understood about your part of the process?"

**Step 5: Workarounds and Adaptations (10 minutes)**
- "How have you adapted to make the process work better?"
- "What unofficial procedures have you developed?"
- "What would a new nurse need to know that isn't in the official procedures?"

**Step 6: Improvement Ideas (10 minutes)**
- "If you could change one thing about the discharge process, what would it be?"
- "What tools or resources would make your job easier?"
- "What works well that we should make sure not to change?"

**Step 7: Future State Vision (10 minutes)**
- "What would an ideal discharge process look like to you?"
- "How would you know if improvements were working?"
- "What concerns would you have about changing the current process?"

**Step 8: Closing (5 minutes)**
"This has been incredibly helpful. Is there anything else you think I should know? Anyone else you'd recommend I speak with? I'll be compiling insights from all interviews and will share general findings with the team once complete. Thank you for your time and expertise."

# L1.C1 Entrevistas com Stakeholders

## Objetivos de Aprendizagem
- Dominar a arte de conduzir entrevistas eficazes com stakeholders para melhoria de processos
- Projetar guias de entrevista que descubram causas raiz e problemas ocultos de processos
- Aplicar técnicas de empathy mapping para entender perspectivas de stakeholders
- Usar técnicas avançadas de questionamento para reunir insights acionáveis
- Gerenciar conversas difíceis e superar resistência de stakeholders

## Cenário do Mundo Real

Lisa, uma consultora de melhoria de processos, foi contratada pelo Mountain View Medical Center, um hospital de 200 leitos lutando com atrasos na alta de pacientes com média de 4,2 horas além das ordens médicas. A administração hospitalar exigiu uma solução rápida, alegando que o problema era "enfermeiras preguiçosas demorando demais com papelada."

A revisão inicial de dados de Lisa revelou um quadro mais complexo: tempos de alta variavam drasticamente entre departamentos (2,1 horas em cardiologia vs. 7,3 horas em ortopedia), scores de satisfação do paciente estavam declinando, e rotatividade de funcionários havia aumentado 35% em seis meses. No entanto, a história real emergiu apenas através de entrevistas cuidadosas com stakeholders.

Durante sua primeira entrevista com a supervisora de enfermagem, Lisa perguntou: "Me conte o que acontece quando você recebe uma ordem de alta." Os olhos da supervisora se iluminaram—finalmente, alguém queria entender em vez de culpar. A conversa revelou que ordens de alta frequentemente chegavam incompletas, exigindo que enfermeiras procurassem médicos por informações faltantes. Atrasos da farmácia significavam esperar 2-3 horas para reconciliação de medicamentos. Serviços de transporte estavam com falta de pessoal, deixando pacientes esperando em leitos necessários para admissões.

Mas o breakthrough veio quando Lisa entrevistou uma enfermeira do turno noturno que revelou: "Começamos a atrasar altas até o turno matutino porque a equipe do dia tem mais recursos para lidar com problemas. Ninguém contou para a gerência porque pensamos que teríamos problemas por admitir que o sistema não funciona."

Lisa percebeu que soluções superficiais falhariam sem entender a dinâmica humana, restrições e workarounds que stakeholders haviam desenvolvido. Entrevistar stakeholders efetivamente não era apenas sobre reunir informação—era sobre construir confiança e descobrir a história real por trás de quebras de processo.

## Teoria Central

### O Propósito das Entrevistas com Stakeholders

Entrevistas com stakeholders servem múltiplas funções críticas na melhoria de processos:

**Coleta de Informação**: Entender como o trabalho realmente é feito versus como deveria ser feito
**Identificação de Problemas**: Descobrir causas raiz por trás de falhas de processo
**Construção de Relacionamento**: Estabelecer confiança e buy-in para esforços de melhoria
**Preparação para Mudança**: Identificar resistência potencial e desafios de implementação
**Validação**: Confirmar ou desafiar suposições sobre performance de processo

### Tipos de Stakeholders

**Stakeholders Primários**: Participantes diretos no processo
- Executores de processo (trabalhadores de linha de frente)
- Proprietários de processo (gerentes responsáveis por resultados)
- Clientes internos (recebem outputs do processo)
- Fornecedores internos (fornecem inputs do processo)

**Stakeholders Secundários**: Indiretamente afetados pelo processo
- Liderança sênior (supervisão estratégica)
- Funções de apoio (TI, RH, Finanças)
- Clientes externos (se aplicável)
- Órgãos reguladores (requisitos de compliance)

**Stakeholders Ocultos**: Frequentemente ignorados mas criticamente importantes
- Líderes informais (trabalhadores respeitados que influenciam outros)
- Especialistas no assunto (conhecimento profundo do processo)
- Trabalhadores do turno noturno (restrições diferentes e workarounds)
- Funcionários meio período (treinamento limitado, perspectivas únicas)

### Planejamento e Preparação de Entrevistas

**Definir Objetivos da Entrevista**: Seja específico sobre o que você precisa aprender
- Entendimento do processo de estado atual
- Pontos de dor e gargalos
- Workarounds e processos informais
- Ideias para melhoria
- Preocupações de implementação

**Mapeamento de Stakeholders**: Identificar quem entrevistar e por quê
- Criar matriz de influência/interesse de stakeholders
- Garantir representação de todas as áreas do processo
- Incluir tanto apoiadores quanto céticos
- Planejar 60-90 minutos por entrevista

**Desenvolvimento de Guia de Entrevista**: Estruturar sem ser rígido
- Abertura (5 min): Apresentações, propósito, confidencialidade
- Estado atual (20 min): Como o trabalho é feito hoje
- Problemas (15 min): Pontos de dor e frustrações
- Ideias (10 min): Sugestões de melhoria
- Estado futuro (10 min): Visão para melhoria

### Técnicas Avançadas de Questionamento

**Perguntas Abertas**: Encorajar respostas detalhadas
- "Me conte o que acontece quando..."
- "Descreva um dia típico em seu papel..."
- "Descreva a última vez que você teve que lidar com..."
- "O que aconteceria se..."

**Perguntas de Sondagem**: Aprofundar nas respostas
- "Você pode me dar um exemplo específico?"
- "O que causa isso acontecer?"
- "Com que frequência isso ocorre?"
- "O que você tentou para abordar isso?"

**Perguntas Hipotéticas**: Explorar possibilidades
- "Se você pudesse mudar uma coisa sobre este processo, o que seria?"
- "O que precisaria acontecer para isso funcionar suavemente?"
- "Se você tivesse recursos ilimitados, como redesenharia isso?"

**Perguntas de Esclarecimento**: Garantir entendimento
- "Quando você diz 'sempre,' você quer dizer toda vez?"
- "Me ajude a entender o que você quer dizer com..."
- "Isso é uma mudança recente ou sempre foi assim?"

**Perguntas de Inteligência Emocional**: Entender sentimentos e motivações
- "Como isso te faz sentir?"
- "O que é mais frustrante sobre esta situação?"
- "Como seria o sucesso para você?"

### O Framework de Entrevista SOAR

**S - Situation**: Entender o contexto
- Qual é seu papel neste processo?
- Há quanto tempo você faz este trabalho?
- Que treinamento você recebeu?
- Com quem você trabalha mais de perto?

**O - Obstacles**: Identificar barreiras e desafios
- O que impede você de fazer seu trabalho efetivamente?
- Onde atrasos tipicamente ocorrem?
- Que recursos você não tem?
- Que políticas ou procedimentos criam problemas?

**A - Aspirations**: Explorar desejos de melhoria
- O que tornaria seu trabalho mais fácil?
- Como você redesenharia este processo?
- Que ferramentas ou recursos ajudariam?
- Como é uma boa performance?

**R - Results**: Entender resultados e impactos
- Como você mede sucesso?
- O que acontece quando as coisas dão errado?
- Quem é afetado por atrasos ou erros?
- Quais são as consequências dos problemas atuais?

### Empathy Mapping para Stakeholders

Empathy mapping ajuda visualizar experiências de stakeholders:

**Says**: Citações diretas das entrevistas
- "Nunca tenho tempo suficiente para fazer isso apropriadamente"
- "O sistema sempre trava durante períodos ocupados"
- "Ninguém pede nossa opinião sobre mudanças"

**Thinks**: Crenças e suposições (nem sempre faladas)
- "A gerência não entende nossos desafios"
- "Esta mudança também não vai funcionar"
- "Eu poderia fazer isso melhor se tivesse as ferramentas certas"

**Does**: Comportamentos e ações observáveis
- Trabalha horas extras para cumprir prazos
- Cria workarounds informais
- Evita usar certos sistemas ou procedimentos

**Feels**: Emoções e sentimentos
- Frustrado com problemas repetitivos
- Orgulhoso do trabalho de qualidade apesar dos obstáculos
- Ansioso sobre segurança no emprego durante mudanças

## Demonstração de Ferramenta

### Conduzindo uma Entrevista com Stakeholder: Passo-a-Passo

Vamos percorrer uma entrevista com uma enfermeira hospitalar sobre atrasos na alta de pacientes:

**Passo 1: Abertura (5 minutos)**
"Obrigado por se encontrar comigo, Sarah. Sou Lisa, trabalhando com sua administração para entender o processo de alta de pacientes. Meu objetivo é aprender como as coisas realmente funcionam para que possamos identificar melhorias que tornem seu trabalho mais fácil, não mais difícil. Tudo que você compartilhar será mantido confidencial—não atribuirei comentários específicos a indivíduos. Você tem alguma pergunta antes de começarmos?"

**Passo 2: Papel e Contexto (10 minutos)**
- "Me conte sobre seu papel aqui. Há quanto tempo você trabalha nesta unidade?"
- "Me conte sobre um turno típico. Quais são suas principais responsabilidades?"
- "Com quem você trabalha mais de perto durante o processo de alta?"

**Passo 3: Processo de Estado Atual (20 minutos)**
- "Vamos focar nas altas de pacientes. Me conte o que acontece desde o momento que você recebe uma ordem de alta."
- "Me conte sobre a última alta que você lidou. Quais foram os passos?"
- "Como você sabe quando todos os requisitos de alta estão completos?"

**Passo 4: Problemas e Pontos de Dor (15 minutos)**
- "O que torna as altas desafiadoras ou frustrantes?"
- "Me conte sobre uma vez quando uma alta não correu bem. O que aconteceu?"
- "O que causa os maiores atrasos em sua experiência?"
- "O que você gostaria que outros departamentos entendessem sobre sua parte do processo?"

**Passo 5: Workarounds e Adaptações (10 minutos)**
- "Como você se adaptou para fazer o processo funcionar melhor?"
- "Que procedimentos não oficiais você desenvolveu?"
- "O que uma nova enfermeira precisaria saber que não está nos procedimentos oficiais?"

**Passo 6: Ideias de Melhoria (10 minutos)**
- "Se você pudesse mudar uma coisa sobre o processo de alta, o que seria?"
- "Que ferramentas ou recursos tornariam seu trabalho mais fácil?"
- "O que funciona bem que devemos garantir não mudar?"

**Passo 7: Visão de Estado Futuro (10 minutos)**
- "Como seria um processo ideal de alta para você?"
- "Como você saberia se as melhorias estavam funcionando?"
- "Que preocupações você teria sobre mudar o processo atual?"

**Passo 8: Fechamento (5 minutos)**
"Isso foi incrivelmente útil. Há mais alguma coisa que você acha que eu deveria saber? Alguém mais que você recomendaria eu falar? Estarei compilando insights de todas as entrevistas e compartilharei descobertas gerais com a equipe uma vez completo. Obrigado pelo seu tempo e expertise."
