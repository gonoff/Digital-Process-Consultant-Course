## Real-World Scenario

With deep understanding of the hospital discharge process and clear evidence that incomplete medication orders were the root cause of delays, Lisa faced her biggest challenge yet: designing a future state that would actually work in the real world.

Her initial TO-BE design was elegant on paper: mandatory medication reconciliation forms, automated physician alerts for incomplete orders, and dedicated pharmacy coverage during peak hours. The solution would theoretically reduce discharge times from 4.2 hours to 90 minutes—a 65% improvement that would delight patients and administrators.

But when Lisa presented her design to the implementation team, reality hit hard.

**Dr. Kim (Emergency Medicine)**: "This form adds 8 minutes to every discharge order. During trauma season, I write 40 discharge orders per shift. That's 5 hours of extra documentation time I don't have."

**Janet (Pharmacy Director)**: "Dedicated peak hour coverage sounds great, but where do I find extra pharmacists? We're already paying 15% above market rate and still can't fill evening positions."

**Marcus (IT Director)**: "Integration with the outpatient pharmacy database would take 18 months and $400,000. The EHR vendor says it's possible, but we'd need to rebuild our medication module."

**Linda (Nursing Supervisor)**: "My nurses are barely keeping up now. Any solution that adds complexity to their workflow will make things worse, not better."

Lisa realized that her TO-BE design, while technically correct, was practically unworkable. She needed to balance ideal process improvement with real-world constraints: limited budgets, staffing shortages, technology limitations, and human change resistance.

Going back to the drawing board, Lisa applied a different approach: design thinking that started with user constraints rather than perfect processes.

**Version 2: Constraint-Based TO-BE Design**

Instead of mandatory forms, Lisa created smart defaults in the EHR system that populated medication histories from previous admissions, reducing physician documentation time by 70%. Instead of additional pharmacists, she redesigned the workflow so that medication reconciliation happened during other waiting periods rather than creating new bottlenecks. Instead of expensive system integration, she created a simple web portal where patients could update their medication lists before admission.

The key insight: effective TO-BE design isn't about creating perfect processes—it's about creating better processes that people will actually use.

## Core Theory

### Principles of Effective TO-BE Design

**User-Centered Design**: Start with the people who will perform the process
- Understand current workarounds and informal practices that work well
- Design around existing skills and capabilities rather than requiring extensive retraining
- Minimize additional complexity, maximize automation of routine tasks
- Test design concepts with actual users before finalizing

**Constraint-Aware Solutions**: Work within realistic organizational limitations
- Budget constraints limiting technology investment and staffing changes
- Technology constraints based on existing systems and integration capabilities
- Cultural constraints reflecting organizational change readiness and resistance patterns
- Regulatory constraints requiring specific procedures or documentation

**Iterative Implementation**: Design for phased rollout rather than big-bang change
- Pilot testing with small groups to validate design assumptions
- Quick wins that build momentum and stakeholder confidence
- Learning cycles that allow design refinement based on real-world feedback
- Gradual expansion that manages risk and builds organizational capability

# L1.C4 Design TO-BE & Definição de KPIs

## Objetivos de Aprendizagem
- Projetar processos de estado futuro que eliminem causas raiz e otimizem workflow
- Criar KPIs mensuráveis que rastreiem performance de processo e sucesso de melhoria
- Aplicar princípios de gestão de mudança para garantir implementação TO-BE bem-sucedida
- Equilibrar design ideal de processo com restrições realistas de implementação
- Desenvolver sistemas de monitoramento que sustentem melhorias de processo ao longo do tempo

## Cenário do Mundo Real

Com entendimento profundo do processo de alta hospitalar e evidência clara de que ordens de medicamentos incompletas eram a causa raiz dos atrasos, Lisa enfrentou seu maior desafio ainda: projetar um estado futuro que realmente funcionaria no mundo real.

Seu design inicial TO-BE era elegante no papel: formulários obrigatórios de reconciliação de medicamentos, alertas automatizados para médicos sobre ordens incompletas, e cobertura dedicada de farmácia durante horários de pico. A solução teoricamente reduziria tempos de alta de 4,2 horas para 90 minutos—uma melhoria de 65% que deleitaria pacientes e administradores.

Mas quando Lisa apresentou seu design para a equipe de implementação, a realidade bateu forte.

**Dr. Kim (Medicina de Emergência)**: "Este formulário adiciona 8 minutos a cada ordem de alta. Durante temporada de trauma, escrevo 40 ordens de alta por turno. São 5 horas de tempo extra de documentação que não tenho."

**Janet (Diretora de Farmácia)**: "Cobertura dedicada em horário de pico soa ótimo, mas onde encontro farmacêuticos extras? Já pagamos 15% acima da taxa de mercado e ainda não conseguimos preencher posições noturnas."

**Marcus (Diretor de TI)**: "Integração com banco de dados de farmácia ambulatorial levaria 18 meses e $400.000. O fornecedor do EHR diz que é possível, mas precisaríamos reconstruir nosso módulo de medicamentos."

**Linda (Supervisora de Enfermagem)**: "Minhas enfermeiras mal estão conseguindo manter o ritmo agora. Qualquer solução que adicione complexidade ao workflow delas vai piorar as coisas, não melhorar."

Lisa percebeu que seu design TO-BE, embora tecnicamente correto, era praticamente inviável. Ela precisava equilibrar melhoria ideal de processo com restrições do mundo real: orçamentos limitados, escassez de pessoal, limitações tecnológicas e resistência humana à mudança.

Voltando à prancheta, Lisa aplicou uma abordagem diferente: design thinking que começou com restrições do usuário em vez de processos perfeitos.

**Versão 2: Design TO-BE Baseado em Restrições**

Em vez de formulários obrigatórios, Lisa criou defaults inteligentes no sistema EHR que populavam históricos de medicamentos de admissões anteriores, reduzindo tempo de documentação médica em 70%. Em vez de farmacêuticos adicionais, ela redesenhou o workflow para que reconciliação de medicamentos acontecesse durante outros períodos de espera em vez de criar novos gargalos. Em vez de integração cara de sistema, ela criou um portal web simples onde pacientes poderiam atualizar suas listas de medicamentos antes da admissão.

O insight chave: design TO-BE eficaz não é sobre criar processos perfeitos—é sobre criar processos melhores que pessoas realmente usarão.

## Teoria Central

### Princípios de Design TO-BE Eficaz

**Design Centrado no Usuário**: Comece com as pessoas que executarão o processo
- Entenda workarounds atuais e práticas informais que funcionam bem
- Projete em torno de habilidades e capacidades existentes em vez de exigir retreinamento extensivo
- Minimize complexidade adicional, maximize automação de tarefas rotineiras
- Teste conceitos de design com usuários reais antes de finalizar

**Soluções Conscientes de Restrições**: Trabalhe dentro de limitações organizacionais realistas
- Restrições orçamentárias limitando investimento tecnológico e mudanças de pessoal
- Restrições tecnológicas baseadas em sistemas existentes e capacidades de integração
- Restrições culturais refletindo prontidão organizacional para mudança e padrões de resistência
- Restrições regulatórias exigindo procedimentos específicos ou documentação

**Implementação Iterativa**: Projete para rollout em fases em vez de mudança big-bang
- Teste piloto com grupos pequenos para validar suposições de design
- Vitórias rápidas que constroem momentum e confiança de stakeholder
- Ciclos de aprendizado que permitem refinamento de design baseado em feedback do mundo real
- Expansão gradual que gerencia risco e constrói capacidade organizacional
