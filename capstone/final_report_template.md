## Current State Analysis

### Business Context and Challenges

MidWest Manufacturing Solutions, a 36-year-old light manufacturing company in Columbus, Ohio, faced unprecedented competitive pressure in Q1 2024. With 218 employees and $47M annual revenue, the company built their reputation on quality and customer service but found themselves at a strategic inflection point.

#### Market Pressures
- **Competitor Modernization**: Three key competitors implemented advanced operations, offering 15-20% faster delivery
- **Customer Ultimatum**: AutoTech Industries demanded 30% cycle time improvement or contract termination
- **Cost Inflation**: 18% raw material cost increases without corresponding price increases
- **Workforce Transition**: 35% of skilled workforce approaching retirement

#### Financial Performance Impact
- **Revenue Decline**: 3% year-over-year despite market growth
- **Margin Compression**: Gross margin fell from 28% to 24%
- **Cash Flow Stress**: 87-day cash conversion cycle well above industry norms
- **Profitability Pressure**: EBITDA declined from 12% to 8%

### Process Assessment Findings

Through comprehensive analysis using stakeholder interviews, process mapping, and data analysis, we identified systemic inefficiencies across the order-to-cash process:

#### Order Entry and Validation (2.3 days average)
**Current State Challenges**:
- Manual entry across 8 ERP screens with 30% error rate
- Three separate systems requiring duplicate data entry
- Paper-based documentation flow causing delays
- No real-time validation leading to downstream rework

**Root Causes**:
- Legacy ERP system (2008) with no integration capabilities
- Lack of customer portal forcing phone/email orders
- Manual credit checking process
- Insufficient data validation rules

#### Production Planning (3.2 days average)
**Current State Challenges**:
- Excel-based planning with 47 columns and 300+ rows
- Single point of failure (Sarah Williams) for all planning
- Manual supplier calls (8-12 daily) for material status
- Schedule changes requiring 2-3 hours daily maintenance

**Root Causes**:
- No integration between ERP and production planning
- Lack of real-time inventory visibility
- Paper-based communication to production floor
- Reactive planning vs. predictive capabilities

- Delayed cash collection (15-25 days average)
- Limited customer communication

**Root Causes**:
- Disconnected shipping and accounting systems
- Paper-based documentation transfer
- Manual invoice generation process
- No automated payment processing

### Waste Analysis

Using Lean methodology, we quantified eight types of waste consuming $7.03M annually (15% of revenue):

| Waste Type | Annual Cost | Primary Causes |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Waiting** | $1.2M | Manual information gathering and approvals |
| **Transport** | $380K | Physical document movement |
| **Motion** | $580K | Excessive clicking and paper handling |
| **Defects** | $950K | 30% order errors and 8% rework rate |
| **Over-processing** | $720K | Redundant data entry and documentation |
| **Over-production** | $620K | Excess WIP due to poor scheduling |
| **Inventory** | $2.1M | 15% excess stock from poor visibility |
| **Underutilized Skills** | $480K | Manual tasks preventing value-added work |

### Technology Assessment

#### Current Technology Landscape
- **ERP System**: Modified SageX3 (2008) with no upgrade path
- **Integration**: Zero automated interfaces between systems
