## Opening & Rapport Building (Minutes 1-10)

**Consultant**: Good morning everyone. Thank you for making time for this discovery session. Before we dive into the operational challenges, I'd like to understand the human side of this business. Jim, can you tell me what you're most proud of in MidWest Manufacturing's 36-year journey?

**Jim Patterson (CEO)**: *[settles back in chair]* Well, I'm proud that we've never missed payroll, never had a serious safety incident, and our customers know they can count on us. When AutoTech had that emergency last year - their supplier failed and they needed 500 assemblies in 10 days - we made it happen. That's who we are.

**Consultant**: That speaks to something special about your culture. Maria, you came from a larger manufacturer three years ago. What drew you to MidWest?

**Maria Rodriguez (CFO)**: *[smiles]* Honestly? The fact that Jim knew every employee's name and their families. You don't see that in Fortune 500 companies. But... *[expression becomes serious]* we're at a crossroads. Our family culture won't matter if we can't compete.

**Dave Chen (VP Operations)**: *[crosses arms]* Look, I've been here 18 years. I've seen consultants come through before promising the moon. We've got good people doing honest work. I'm not sure we need to turn everything upside down.

**Consultant**: Dave, I respect that perspective. Your experience is exactly why I'm here to listen first. Nothing changes without understanding what's already working. Can you tell me about a recent success your team delivered?

**Dave Chen**: *[relaxes slightly]* Last month we delivered the Morrison contract two days early. Complex assembly job - 47 components, tight tolerances. My guys worked Saturday to make it happen.

**Consultant**: That's impressive. What enabled that success? Let's start there and build on your strengths.

## Current State Deep Dive (Minutes 11-35)

### Order-to-Cash Process Analysis

**Consultant**: Let's walk through your order-to-cash process. Sarah, you manage production planning - take me through what happens when Jennifer's team receives a new order.

**Sarah Williams (Production Planning)**: *[pulls out thick folder]* Okay, so Jennifer's team receives the order - usually by email, sometimes phone for rush jobs. They enter it into our ERP system, which... *[pauses]* well, it's not user-friendly. Takes about 45 minutes per order because you have to click through 8 different screens.

**Maria Rodriguez**: And that's if there are no errors. We get errors on about 30% of new orders because the ERP doesn't validate part numbers or customer specifications.

**Dave Chen**: When there's an error, it bounces back to customer service, then to engineering, then to me. Could take two days just to figure out what the customer actually wants.

**Consultant**: So order entry alone could take 2-3 days? What's driving the errors?

**Sarah Williams**: The ERP was set up in 2008. Customer part numbers have changed, we've got duplicate entries, and some fields are required that don't make sense anymore. Plus, Jennifer's team has to manually check against credit limits because that system doesn't talk to the ERP.

**Maria Rodriguez**: *[frustrated]* We're basically running three separate systems that should be integrated. Customer service in one system, credit in another, production planning in Excel because the ERP planning module is unusable.

**Consultant**: Dave, from your operations perspective, when do you first see the order?

**Dave Chen**: After Sarah's done her planning magic in Excel. *[chuckles]* She sends me a printed sheet - we've got four colors of paper for different priorities. Green for standard, yellow for expedite, red for emergency, blue for new product orders.

**Consultant**: How often do priorities change once you've started production?

**Dave Chen**: *[grimaces]* Daily. Maybe more. AutoTech called yesterday and moved up their delivery date by a week. That meant stopping three jobs to expedite theirs.

**Sarah Williams**: *[defensive]* I maintain all the schedule changes in my master spreadsheet. It's got 47 columns tracking everything from material availability to machine schedules. Dave's team knows to check with me before making any changes.

**Consultant**: Sarah, you're clearly the hub that keeps everything coordinated. What happens when you're not available?

**Sarah Williams**: *[quietly]* Nothing. The whole thing stops. When I was out sick for three days last month, we missed two delivery dates because nobody else understands my system.

### Material Planning & Procurement

**Consultant**: Let's talk about the 5-15 day variability in material procurement. Maria, what's driving that?

**Maria Rodriguez**: *[sighs]* We don't have real-time inventory visibility. Sarah's spreadsheet shows what should be available, but actual inventory could be different. We find out when production starts and materials aren't there.

**Dave Chen**: Half the time we're expediting materials because we didn't know we needed them until the week of production. That 5-day lead time becomes 15 when you're paying for rush shipping.

**Consultant**: Who manages supplier relationships and purchasing?

**Jim Patterson**: That's Maria's team. We've got one purchasing agent, Betty, who's been here 20 years. She knows all our suppliers personally but doesn't use any automated systems.

**Maria Rodriguez**: Betty tracks everything in her head and spiral notebooks. She's fantastic, but when she retires next year... *[trails off]* We've got no documentation of supplier terms, lead times, or performance history.

**Consultant**: What's your biggest supplier challenge right now?

**Dave Chen**: Steel prices are crazy, and our supplier can't commit to delivery dates more than two weeks out. But we're quoting 6-week deliveries to customers based on old assumptions.

**Sarah Williams**: I have to call suppliers every morning to check on orders. Sometimes I find out materials are delayed and have to completely re-shuffle the production schedule.

### Manufacturing Operations

**Consultant**: Dave, walk me through your production floor. How do you track job progress?

**Dave Chen**: *[proudly]* We've got five production lines. Each job gets a traveler packet - paper form with routing, specs, and sign-offs for each operation. Workers move the packet with the job.

**Consultant**: How do you know where jobs are at any given time?

**Dave Chen**: I walk the floor three times a day and check with line supervisors. We've got a whiteboard in my office showing job status - not started, in progress, complete.

**Sarah Williams**: *[frustrated]* But when Jennifer gets customer calls asking for status updates, we have to physically find the job on the floor. Could take 30 minutes to get an answer.

**Maria Rodriguez**: And if a job hits a problem - maybe a quality issue or machine breakdown - we don't know about it until Dave's next walkthrough. Could lose half a day before we react.

**Consultant**: What about quality documentation? How do you track inspections and approvals?

**Dave Chen**: Robert Thompson runs quality. Every job gets inspected at key points, and he keeps paper records in filing cabinets. We've never failed an audit.

**Jim Patterson**: *[firmly]* Quality is non-negotiable. We'd rather be late than ship defective parts.

**Consultant**: I respect that commitment. How long does quality documentation typically take?

**Dave Chen**: Depends on the job complexity. Simple parts, maybe 30 minutes. Complex assemblies with multiple inspection points, could be 3-4 hours just for paperwork.

### Shipping & Invoicing

**Consultant**: Let's talk about the final steps. What happens after production is complete?

**Sarah Williams**: The completed job goes to shipping with the traveler packet. Shipping verifies the quantity and creates a packing slip - manually typed into Word.

**Maria Rodriguez**: *[frustrated]* Then the packet comes to accounting for invoicing. But sometimes information is missing from the traveler - maybe a change order wasn't documented or shipping modified quantities.

**Consultant**: How often do you have invoicing delays due to missing information?

**Maria Rodriguez**: About 20% of jobs require follow-up. We have to track down what happened, get clarification, sometimes go back to the customer. Could add 3-5 days to the invoice cycle.

**Dave Chen**: And meanwhile, the job is technically complete but we can't call it done until the invoice is sent.

## Pain Point Prioritization (Minutes 36-50)

**Consultant**: I've heard several recurring themes. Let me reflect back what I'm understanding, and you tell me what resonates most. First, there's a lot of manual work that could be automated - order entry, production tracking, quality documentation. Second, you've got information silos - Sarah's spreadsheet, Dave's whiteboards, Robert's filing cabinets. Third, you're reactive instead of proactive - finding out about problems after they've already impacted the schedule.

**Maria Rodriguez**: *[nods vigorously]* Exactly. We're managing by exception instead of managing by design.

**Dave Chen**: *[hesitates]* I mean... that's how manufacturing works. Things break, customers change orders, suppliers are late. You adapt.

**Consultant**: Dave, you're absolutely right that adaptability is crucial. The question is whether you're adapting quickly enough to stay competitive. When AutoTech calls with an expedite request, how long does it take to give them a realistic delivery date?

**Dave Chen**: *[pauses]* Usually a few hours. Sarah has to check material availability, I have to see what jobs we can move, then we hope nothing else changes.

**Sarah Williams**: And sometimes we commit to a date and then realize we missed something. Last week we promised a Tuesday delivery and didn't realize until Monday that we needed a special heat treat cycle.

**Consultant**: If you could solve one problem that would make the biggest difference, what would it be?

**Jim Patterson**: *[immediately]* Real-time visibility. I want to walk into any customer meeting and know exactly where their jobs stand - what's in queue, what's in progress, what's shipped.

**Maria Rodriguez**: For me, it's integration. Stop moving information manually between systems. Let technology do the repetitive work so people can focus on solving problems.

**Dave Chen**: *[thoughtfully]* I'd want early warning. If a job's going to be late, tell me when there's still time to do something about it, not after the delivery date has passed.

**Sarah Williams**: I want backup. If something happens to me, the company shouldn't stop. And I want to stop spending 2 hours every morning updating spreadsheets.

### Cultural Readiness Assessment

**Consultant**: I've seen organizations succeed and fail with similar transformations. The difference usually comes down to people, not technology. Dave, what's your biggest concern about change?

**Dave Chen**: *[honest]* My guys have been doing this for 15-20 years. They're proud of their work. I don't want them thinking they're being replaced by computers.

**Consultant**: That's a valid concern. How would you feel about technology that made your team more effective rather than replaced them?

**Dave Chen**: *[considers]* Like what?

**Consultant**: What if instead of walking the floor three times a day to check job status, you had a dashboard that showed real-time progress? You'd spend that time solving problems instead of hunting for information.

**Sarah Williams**: *[excited]* And what if the system automatically flagged potential delays before they happened? I could focus on exception handling instead of daily data entry.

**Maria Rodriguez**: The goal isn't to eliminate jobs - it's to eliminate the parts of jobs that don't add value. Let people do what people do best.

## Technology & Integration Discussion (Minutes 51-70)

### Current System Limitations

**Consultant**: Tom Mitchell, your IT manager, mentioned some challenges with the current ERP system. Maria, from a business perspective, what are the biggest technology barriers?

**Maria Rodriguez**: *[frustrated]* The ERP was customized so heavily in 2008 that we can't upgrade it. No APIs, no integration capabilities, and the vendor basically doesn't support our version anymore.

**Consultant**: What would it take to replace the ERP?

**Jim Patterson**: *[grimaces]* We got a quote last year - $200,000 just for software, plus six months of disruption. Tom said we'd need to rebuild all our customer interfaces and reports.

**Dave Chen**: Plus retraining everybody. My production supervisors finally learned this system - took them two years.

**Consultant**: What if we didn't replace the ERP immediately? What if we created a layer on top that gave you integration and real-time visibility while keeping the core system?

**Maria Rodriguez**: *[interested]* You mean like middleware? Connect everything without ripping out the foundation?

**Sarah Williams**: Could we keep my spreadsheets but have them automatically updated from real data?

**Consultant**: Think bigger. What if you didn't need spreadsheets because the system gave you the visibility and control you needed directly?

### Integration Opportunities

**Consultant**: Let's talk about quick wins. What's the fastest way to improve order-to-cash cycle time?

**Maria Rodriguez**: Eliminate the order entry errors. If customer service could enter orders once, correctly, with automatic validation, we'd save 1-2 days on 30% of orders.

**Dave Chen**: Real-time inventory visibility. If we knew material status before starting production planning, Sarah wouldn't have to call suppliers every morning.

**Sarah Williams**: Automated production tracking. If the system knew where jobs were, customer service could answer status questions immediately instead of hunting for travelers.

**Consultant**: Those are all achievable with current technology. What about longer-term opportunities?

**Jim Patterson**: *[thoughtful]* Predictive capabilities. If the system could tell us when a job was likely to be late while we could still do something about it.

**Maria Rodriguez**: Better customer communication. What if customers could log in and see their job status themselves? Reduce customer service calls and improve satisfaction.

**Dave Chen**: *[warming up]* Quality integration. If quality checkpoints were built into the production tracking, we'd catch problems faster and have better documentation.

### Budget & ROI Discussion

**Consultant**: Let's talk about investment and returns. You mentioned a $450,000 budget for transformation. How do you think about ROI?

**Maria Rodriguez**: *[CFO mode]* We need payback within 18 months, preferably 12. The AutoTech contract alone is worth $15 million annually - if we lose that, any technology investment is irrelevant.

**Consultant**: What if you could demonstrate 50% improvement in order-to-cash cycle within 90 days on a pilot product line?

**Jim Patterson**: *[leans forward]* That would get my attention. How?

**Consultant**: Start with your highest-volume, most predictable product line. Implement automated order entry, real-time inventory checking, and mobile production tracking for just those jobs. Prove the concept before scaling.

**Dave Chen**: *[skeptical]* What happens to the other 80% of jobs while we're piloting?

**Consultant**: They continue as-is. No disruption to current operations. But you'll have data comparing old process versus new process on similar work.

**Sarah Williams**: *[excited]* And I could learn the new system gradually instead of everything changing at once?

**Maria Rodriguez**: What kind of savings are we talking about?

**Consultant**: Based on similar manufacturing transformations, you should see 25-40% reduction in cycle time, 60-80% reduction in order errors, and 30-50% improvement in on-time delivery. For your revenue base, that translates to $2-3 million in annual value.

## Vision & Success Criteria (Minutes 71-85)

### Future State Visioning

**Consultant**: Let's paint a picture of success. Six months from now, Jim, you're walking into a meeting with AutoTech. How has your conversation changed?

**Jim Patterson**: *[brightening]* Instead of apologizing for delays and asking for patience, I'm showing them real-time dashboards of their jobs. Maybe even offering shorter delivery times because we're more efficient.

**Consultant**: Maria, what does success look like from a financial perspective?

**Maria Rodriguez**: Cash conversion cycle from 87 days to 60 days. That's $8 million in working capital improvement. Plus we're not expediting materials constantly, so procurement costs drop 10-15%.

**Dave Chen**: *[thoughtfully]* My guys aren't firefighting all day. They can focus on continuous improvement instead of constantly reacting to crises.

**Sarah Williams**: I'm doing strategic planning instead of administrative data entry. Looking ahead instead of just tracking what happened.

### Organizational Impact

**Consultant**: How does this transformation affect your competitive position?

**Jim Patterson**: We go from defensive to offensive. Instead of matching competitor delivery times, we're setting the standard.

**Maria Rodriguez**: We can take on new customers that we currently can't serve because our cycle times are too long.

**Dave Chen**: *[gaining enthusiasm]* We could offer delivery guarantees. If you know exactly where everything stands, you can make commitments confidently.

**Consultant**: What about your workforce? How do you ensure this strengthens rather than threatens your team?

**Jim Patterson**: Good question. Dave, how do we position this positively?

**Dave Chen**: *[considers]* Focus on making their jobs easier and more meaningful. Instead of hunting for paperwork, they're solving engineering challenges. Instead of manual data entry, they're optimizing processes.

**Sarah Williams**: And maybe we can finally hire junior planners because the system would be documented and teachable, not dependent on my tribal knowledge.

### Success Metrics

**Consultant**: Let's define specific success criteria. What metrics will prove this transformation worked?

**Maria Rodriguez**: Order-to-cash cycle: 42 days to 29 days or better. That's the AutoTech requirement.

**Dave Chen**: On-time delivery: from 78% to 95%. That's world-class performance.

**Sarah Williams**: Order entry errors: from 30% to less than 5%. And customer status inquiry response: from 30 minutes to 30 seconds.

**Jim Patterson**: Customer satisfaction scores improve, and we win at least two new major customers because of our delivery performance.

**Consultant**: Those are measurable and achievable. What about internal metrics?

**Maria Rodriguez**: Inventory turns from 6x to 8x annually. Working capital reduction of $6-8 million.

**Dave Chen**: Production efficiency - we should be able to handle 20% more volume with the same workforce through better planning and reduced rework.

## Next Steps & Engagement Framework (Minutes 86-90)

### Immediate Actions

**Consultant**: Based on our discussion, I recommend a three-phase approach. Phase 1 is a detailed process analysis and technology assessment - 30 days. Phase 2 is pilot implementation on one product line - 60 days. Phase 3 is full rollout - 90 days. Does that timeline align with your urgency?

**Jim Patterson**: That gets us to results in 6 months, which is AutoTech's deadline. What do you need from us?

**Consultant**: A cross-functional project team - 3-4 people part-time. Sarah for process expertise, someone from Dave's team for operations input, Tom for technology, and Maria for business requirements.

**Maria Rodriguez**: How much of their time?

**Consultant**: 15-20 hours per week for Phase 1, ramping to 25-30 hours during implementation. Plus executive steering committee meetings every two weeks.

**Dave Chen**: *[concerned]* We can't afford to take key people off production.

**Consultant**: That's why we start with analysis and pilot. Prove the value before requiring significant resource commitment.

### Risk Mitigation

**Consultant**: Dave, what's your biggest worry about this project?

**Dave Chen**: *[honest]* That we'll spend six months implementing something that doesn't work, and meanwhile we've fallen further behind while our competitors keep moving.

**Consultant**: Fair concern. What if we structure this so you see concrete improvements every 30 days? First month, better order entry. Second month, real-time visibility. Third month, faster production tracking.

**Sarah Williams**: And if something isn't working, we can adjust before it's too late?

**Consultant**: Exactly. This isn't a big-bang implementation. We build momentum through quick wins while working toward the bigger transformation.

**Maria Rodriguez**: What about budget? How do we control costs?

**Consultant**: Fixed-price phases with clear deliverables. You approve each phase before proceeding. No surprises.

### Commitment & Expectations

**Jim Patterson**: Assuming we move forward, what do you need from leadership?

**Consultant**: Visible commitment to the project, especially when people resist change. Resources when needed. And patience - sustainable change takes time even when you're moving fast.

**Dave Chen**: *[thoughtful]* If this works, it could really make a difference for our people and our customers.

**Maria Rodriguez**: The numbers make sense. If we achieve half of what we discussed, the ROI is compelling.

**Sarah Williams**: I'm excited about the possibility of not being the single point of failure for production planning.

**Jim Patterson**: *[decisive]* Let's do it. How do we start?

**Consultant**: I'll provide a detailed project proposal by end of week, including timeline, deliverables, and investment. Meanwhile, I'd like to schedule follow-up sessions with your department heads and key operators to get their perspectives.

**Maria Rodriguez**: Sounds good. I'll coordinate the scheduling and set up the project tracking.

**Dave Chen**: And I'll talk to my supervisors about what we discussed. Get them thinking about improvements instead of just changes.
