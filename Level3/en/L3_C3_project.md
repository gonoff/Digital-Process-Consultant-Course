## Project Overview

**Objective**: Design and implement a complete agile governance framework including Scrum-ban methodology, OKR system, and governance structures for a mid-size organization undergoing process transformation.

**Duration**: 10-12 hours across multiple sessions  
**Deliverable**: Comprehensive agile governance package with implementation playbook and dashboard templates

## Project Scenario Details

### Scenario A: Healthcare Administration Transformation

#### Business Context: Regional Health Partners

**Company Profile**:
Regional Health Partners is a 320-employee healthcare administration company serving 45 medical practices across Texas, handling insurance claims, patient billing, and practice management services. They process 50,000+ patient interactions monthly and manage $8.5M in billing operations across multiple insurance networks.

**Current State Challenges**:
- **Siloed Operations**: Claims, billing, and patient services operate independently with poor coordination
- **Reactive Problem-Solving**: Issues escalate through multiple management layers taking 5-7 days to resolve
- **Unclear Priorities**: Department goals conflict, leading to resource competition and finger-pointing
- **Slow Adaptation**: New insurance requirements take 3-4 months to implement across all practices
- **Performance Gaps**: No real-time visibility into operational metrics or client satisfaction

**Transformation Drivers**:
- New CMS regulations requiring 30-day claim resolution
- Client practices demanding real-time reporting and faster issue resolution
- Staff turnover at 35% annually due to frustration with inefficient processes
- Competition from tech-enabled competitors offering automated solutions

**Success Requirements**:
- Reduce average issue resolution time from 5-7 days to 24 hours
- Achieve 95% compliance with new CMS requirements within 6 months
- Improve employee satisfaction scores from 2.8 to 4.0 (out of 5)
- Maintain client retention rate above 92% during transformation

### Scenario B: Manufacturing Operations Excellence

#### Business Context: Precision Components Inc.

**Company Profile**:
Precision Components Inc. is a 280-employee aerospace parts manufacturer in Ohio producing precision-machined components for commercial and defense applications. They manage complex supply chains, strict quality requirements, and demanding delivery schedules for 15 major aerospace OEMs.

**Current State Challenges**:
- **Quality Coordination**: Multiple quality processes across departments create inconsistencies
- **Production Planning**: Manual scheduling leads to resource conflicts and missed deliveries
- **Continuous Improvement**: Kaizen events happen sporadically without systematic follow-through
- **Decision Bottlenecks**: Shop floor improvements require approval from multiple management levels
- **Performance Measurement**: Monthly reports don't enable real-time course correction

**Transformation Drivers**:
- New AS9100D certification requirements demanding process integration
- Customer pressure for real-time production visibility and quality metrics
- Need to reduce lead times from 6 weeks to 4 weeks while maintaining quality
- Competition from Industry 4.0 enabled manufacturers

**Success Requirements**:
- Achieve 99.5% on-time delivery performance (current: 87%)
- Reduce quality escapes to zero within 12 months
- Improve operational efficiency by 20% through waste elimination
- Enable real-time production visibility for all major customers
