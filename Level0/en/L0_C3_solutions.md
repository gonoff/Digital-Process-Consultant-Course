## Sample Solution: Library Book Checkout Process

### Process Description
The university library book checkout process involves students, librarians, and the automated library system. Students locate books, present their ID cards, and check out materials for academic use. The process includes verification of student status, book availability checks, and due date assignment. Current challenges include long wait times during peak hours, confusion about renewal procedures, and difficulty locating books that show as available in the system but are missing from shelves.

### Sample BPMN Analysis
**Bottlenecks**: Scanner system slowness during peak hours, manual verification when student ID system is down
**Handoff Issues**: Transition from self-service book location to librarian checkout creates confusion
**Decision Clarity**: Renewal criteria and late fee policies are unclear to students
**Improvements**: Implement mobile checkout app, add book location assistance, create clear policy displays

## Evaluation Rubric

### BPMN Notation (25 points)
- **Outstanding (22-25)**: Correct symbols, proper naming conventions, complete flows
- **Proficient (18-21)**: Mostly correct with minor notation errors
- **Developing (15-17)**: Basic BPMN understanding with some errors
- **Inadequate (0-14)**: Significant notation errors or misunderstanding

### Swimlane Organization (25 points)
- **Outstanding (22-25)**: Clear responsibility assignment, logical lane structure
- **Proficient (18-21)**: Good organization with minor clarity issues
- **Developing (15-17)**: Basic swimlane concept with some confusion
- **Inadequate (0-14)**: Poor or missing swimlane organization

## Common Mistakes
1. **Symbol Confusion**: Using wrong shapes for events vs activities
2. **Incomplete Flows**: Paths that don't lead to end events
3. **Poor Naming**: Vague activity names like "Do work"
4. **Missing Swimlanes**: Not clearly showing who does what
5. **Gateway Errors**: Wrong gateway types for decision logic
