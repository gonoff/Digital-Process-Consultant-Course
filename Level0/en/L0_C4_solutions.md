## Sample Solution: Home Office 5S Implementation

### Current State Analysis
My home office serves for remote work, online learning, and personal projects. Key waste identified:
- **Motion**: Searching through multiple drawers for supplies (15 min/day)
- **Waiting**: Waiting for printer to connect due to cable issues (5 min/session)
- **Inventory**: Excess paper, old electronics taking space
- **Extra Processing**: Re-organizing same items repeatedly
- **Defects**: Lost documents requiring recreation
- **Transportation**: Moving items between desk and storage areas

Estimated impact: 45 minutes daily wasted, reducing productivity and increasing stress.

### 5S Implementation Plan
**Sort**: Remove old electronics, excess supplies, unneeded papers
**Set in Order**: Create designated zonesâ€”active work area, reference materials, supplies. Use drawer organizers and labeled containers.
**Shine**: Daily 5-minute cleanup, weekly desk cleaning, monthly cable management
**Standardize**: Create setup diagram, supply checklists, digital file naming conventions
**Sustain**: Weekly self-audits, monthly review meetings, reward system for maintaining standards

## Evaluation Guidelines

### Waste Identification Assessment
- **Excellent**: 6+ waste types with specific examples and quantified impact
- **Good**: 4-5 waste types with clear examples
- **Developing**: 3-4 waste types with basic examples
- **Needs Work**: <3 waste types or vague examples

### 5S Plan Quality
- **Excellent**: Comprehensive plan with specific actions for each S
- **Good**: Clear plan with most elements addressed
- **Developing**: Basic plan with some elements missing
- **Needs Work**: Vague or incomplete 5S planning

## Common Student Mistakes
1. **Generic Waste Examples**: "Things are messy" vs. specific waste types
2. **Unrealistic Plans**: Overly complex 5S implementations
3. **Missing Sustain**: Focusing only on initial organization
4. **No Quantification**: Failing to estimate time/cost impacts
5. **Poor Documentation**: Unclear photos or descriptions
