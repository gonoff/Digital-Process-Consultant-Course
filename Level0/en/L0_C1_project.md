## Project Overview

Apply systems thinking principles to analyze a real-world business challenge. This project will help you practice identifying system structures, feedback loops, and leverage points in an actual business context.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Apply systems thinking to identify root causes rather than symptoms
- Create stakeholder maps to understand system boundaries
- Construct causal-loop diagrams showing feedback relationships
- Identify high-leverage intervention points
- Distinguish between symptom-focused and structure-focused solutions

## Project Requirements

### Business Selection Criteria

Choose a local business that meets these criteria:
- You can observe their operations directly (restaurant, retail store, service provider)
- They appear to have a recurring, visible problem
- You can identify at least 3-4 stakeholder groups affected by the issue
- The problem has multiple symptoms (not just a single, isolated issue)

**Common business challenges suitable for analysis:**
- Long customer wait times with high abandonment rates
- Inconsistent product/service quality
- High employee turnover affecting service levels
- Customer service complaints affecting reputation
- Inventory problems (stockouts or excess inventory)
- Scheduling conflicts causing operational disruptions

### Deliverable 1: Problem Statement (150 words)

Write a concise problem statement that includes:

**Required Elements:**
- Business name, type, and approximate size
- Description of observable symptoms (what you can see happening)
- Impact on different stakeholder groups
- Timeline: How long has this been occurring?
- Current attempted solutions (if any) and their results

**Example Structure:**
> "[Business Name] is a [type/size] business that has been experiencing [primary symptoms] for [timeframe]. This manifests as [specific observable behaviors/metrics]. The problem affects [stakeholder groups] by [specific impacts]. Management has attempted to address this through [current solutions], which has resulted in [outcomes]. The recurring nature suggests underlying systemic issues rather than isolated incidents."

### Deliverable 2: Stakeholder Map (Visual)

Create a visual stakeholder map showing:

**Primary Stakeholders** (directly involved in daily operations):
- Customers (different segments if applicable)
- Employees (different roles/levels)
- Management/owners
- Suppliers/vendors

**Secondary Stakeholders** (affected by but not directly involved):
- Community members
- Competitors
- Regulatory bodies (if applicable)
- Family members of employees/owners

**Map Requirements:**
- Visual representation (hand-drawn sketch, digital diagram, or simple flowchart)
- Show relationships between stakeholder groups
- Indicate which stakeholders are most affected by the problem
- Note any conflicting interests between stakeholder groups

### Deliverable 3: Causal-Loop Diagram (Visual)

Construct a causal-loop diagram that includes:

**Technical Requirements:**
- Minimum 6 variables connected in causal relationships
- At least 2 complete feedback loops (one reinforcing, one balancing if possible)
- Proper notation: arrows with + or - polarity
- Delay markers (||) where significant time delays exist
- Loop labels (R for reinforcing, B for balancing)

**Content Requirements:**
- Variables should represent measurable aspects of the system
- Loops should explain how the problem perpetuates itself
- Include both problem-creating and problem-solving dynamics
- Show how current solutions might create unintended consequences

**Common Variables to Consider:**
- Employee stress/satisfaction
- Customer satisfaction/complaints
- Wait times/service speed
- Quality levels
- Management pressure
- Resource availability
- Training levels
- Workload distribution

### Deliverable 4: Intervention Analysis (300 words)

Analyze potential intervention points:

**Section A: Leverage Point Identification (150 words)**
Identify three potential leverage points where small changes could produce significant system improvements:

1. **High-leverage point**: Changes to system structure, goals, or paradigms
2. **Medium-leverage point**: Changes to rules, power distribution, or information flows
3. **Low-leverage point**: Changes to parameters, numbers, or subsidies

For each point, explain:
- What specific change you would make
- Why this point has leverage in the system
- What system behavior you expect to change

**Section B: Root Cause vs. Symptom Analysis (150 words)**
Explain why addressing symptoms alone won't solve the underlying issue:

- Identify the most obvious symptom-focused solutions
- Explain how these solutions might create policy resistance
- Describe potential unintended consequences of symptom-focused approaches
- Argue for why structural changes are necessary for lasting improvement

## Submission Format

**File Name:** `systems_analysis_[business_name].pdf`

**Document Structure:**
1. Cover page with business name and your name
2. Problem Statement (150 words)
3. Stakeholder Map (full page visual)
4. Causal-Loop Diagram (full page visual)
5. Intervention Analysis (300 words)
6. References (if you conducted any research or interviews)

## Evaluation Criteria

### Excellent (90-100%)
- Demonstrates clear understanding of systems vs. linear thinking
- Accurately identifies multiple feedback loops with proper notation
- Proposes interventions that address root causes and system structure
- Shows sophisticated understanding of unintended consequences
- Stakeholder analysis reveals complex system relationships

### Proficient (80-89%)
- Shows good grasp of systems thinking concepts
- Identifies at least one clear feedback loop
- Proposes some interventions that go beyond symptom treatment
- Demonstrates awareness of stakeholder interconnections
- Analysis shows understanding of basic system dynamics

### Developing (70-79%)
- Shows basic understanding of systems concepts
- Attempts to identify system relationships but may have errors
- Interventions mix symptom and structure approaches
- Stakeholder map is present but relationships unclear
- Analysis demonstrates effort but limited depth

### Inadequate (Below 70%)
- Approaches problem with primarily linear thinking
- Fails to identify meaningful feedback loops
- Focuses mainly on symptom-based solutions
- Stakeholder analysis is superficial
- Little evidence of systems thinking application

## Helpful Resources

**Tools for Creating Diagrams:**
- Draw.io (free online diagramming tool)
- Lucidchart (free tier available)
- Hand-drawn sketches (perfectly acceptable)
- PowerPoint or Google Slides

**Research Tips:**
- Observe the business during different times/days
- Note patterns in customer behavior
- Pay attention to employee interactions and stress indicators
- Look for queue formations, bottlenecks, or workflow interruptions
- Consider seasonal or cyclical variations

## Extension Opportunities

**For Advanced Learners:**
- Interview a manager or employee to validate your analysis
- Research industry benchmarks to quantify the problem impact
- Create a simple simulation model of one feedback loop
- Develop a detailed implementation plan for your highest-leverage intervention

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Linear Problem Definition**: "Sales are down because of competition" instead of exploring system dynamics
2. **Single-Point Solutions**: Focusing on one fix instead of understanding system behavior
3. **Blame Assignment**: Looking for who's at fault rather than what system structures create the behavior
4. **Ignoring Delays**: Not accounting for time lags between cause and effect
5. **Oversimplified Loops**: Creating fake feedback relationships that don't reflect real causal mechanisms

## Next Steps

After completing this project, you'll be ready to move into Chapter 0.2, where we'll explore how business processes create value and how to map basic process flows using standardized notation.

Your systems thinking foundation will be essential as we begin to design and improve specific business processes.
