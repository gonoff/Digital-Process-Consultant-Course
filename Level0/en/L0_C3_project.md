## Project Overview

Create a comprehensive BPMN process map for a real service process, demonstrating proper use of BPMN notation, swimlanes, and process analysis skills.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Apply BPMN symbols correctly in a real-world context
- Design effective swimlane diagrams showing cross-functional responsibilities
- Identify process bottlenecks and improvement opportunities
- Communicate process flows clearly using standardized notation

## Deliverables

### 1. Process Description (150 words)
Describe your chosen process, participants, and current challenges.

### 2. BPMN Diagram (Visual)
Create a process map with:
- Minimum 3 swimlanes
- 8-12 activities with proper verb-noun naming
- At least 2 gateways (decision points)
- Proper start and end events
- Sequence flows and message flows where appropriate

### 3. Process Analysis (200 words)
Analyze bottlenecks, handoff issues, decision clarity, and improvement opportunities.

## Technical Requirements
- Use standard BPMN symbols
- Professional diagram presentation
- All process paths must be complete

**File to submit**: `bpmn_process_map_[process_name].pdf`

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct BPMN notation (25%)
- Clear swimlane organization (25%)
- Logical process flow (25%)
- Analysis quality (25%)
