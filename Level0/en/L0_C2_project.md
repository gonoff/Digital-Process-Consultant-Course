## Project Overview

Apply SIPOC analysis to understand the scope, inputs, outputs, and stakeholders of a real process you participate in. This project will help you practice process thinking and develop skills in defining process boundaries—essential capabilities for business process consulting.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Apply SIPOC methodology to analyze a real-world process
- Distinguish between different types of process inputs and outputs
- Identify internal and external customers and suppliers
- Recognize value-added versus non-value-added activities
- Propose process improvements based on systematic analysis

## Project Requirements

### Process Selection Guidelines

Your chosen process must meet these criteria:

**Scope Requirements:**
- Complete process from start to finish (not just a single task)
- You participate in or closely observe the entire process
- Process repeats regularly (at least monthly)
- Involves multiple people, departments, or organizations
- Has clear inputs that trigger the process and outputs that conclude it

**Complexity Requirements:**
- Minimum 4 distinct process steps
- At least 3 different types of inputs
- At least 2 different stakeholder groups
- Some handoffs or coordination between parties

**Suitable Process Examples:**

**Professional/Academic:**
- Course assignment completion (professor assignment → student grade submission)
- Job application process (job search → interview/hiring decision)
- Monthly expense reporting (expense incurrence → reimbursement)
- Event planning process (initial request → event completion)
- Content creation workflow (idea generation → publication)
- Project delivery process (project initiation → client acceptance)

**Personal/Household:**
- Monthly budgeting and financial planning
- Weekly meal planning and grocery shopping
- Home maintenance and repair coordination
- Travel planning and booking process
- Large purchase decision-making process

**Volunteer/Community:**
- Fundraising event organization
- Community newsletter production
- Local sports team coordination
- Religious service planning

### Deliverable 1: Process Selection and Justification (100 words)

Provide a clear rationale for your process choice:

**Required Elements:**
- Process name and brief description
- Your role in the process (participant, observer, coordinator)
- Why this process is suitable for SIPOC analysis
- What makes this process important or challenging

**Example:**
> "I selected the 'Monthly Budget Planning and Expense Tracking' process that I manage for my household. As the primary coordinator, I experience the complete process from gathering financial data through implementing spending decisions. This process involves multiple financial institutions as suppliers, various family members as stakeholders, and produces outputs used for financial planning and spending decisions. The process repeats monthly with consistent inputs and outputs, making it ideal for SIPOC analysis. Recent challenges with overspending and poor tracking make process improvement particularly valuable."

### Deliverable 2: SIPOC Diagram (Visual)

Create a comprehensive SIPOC diagram with these specifications:

**Format Requirements:**
- Visual representation (table, flowchart, or diagram format)
- Clear labels for each SIPOC element
- Professional appearance (hand-drawn acceptable if neat)

**Content Requirements:**

**Suppliers (minimum 3):**
- External suppliers (organizations, vendors, service providers)
- Internal suppliers (other departments, family members, team members)
- Information suppliers (data sources, systems, reports)

**Inputs (minimum 4):**
- Physical materials or resources
- Information or data
- Services or expertise
- Approvals or permissions
- Financial resources
- Time or scheduling constraints

**Process Steps (4-7 high-level steps):**
- Start with triggering event
- Include major decision points
- Show key handoffs or coordination points
- End with process completion

**Outputs (minimum 3):**
- Primary outputs (main deliverables)
- Secondary outputs (reports, documentation, approvals)
- Waste or by-products (if applicable)

**Customers (minimum 2):**
- Primary customers (who receives main outputs)
- Secondary customers (who uses reports, documentation, etc.)
- Internal customers (yourself, team members, family)
- External customers (clients, community, organizations)

### Deliverable 3: Process Analysis (300 words)

Analyze your process across four dimensions:

**Section A: Current State Issues (75 words)**
Identify specific problems or inefficiencies:
- Where do delays commonly occur?
- What causes quality problems or rework?
- Which steps create frustration for participants?
- What resources are frequently inadequate?

**Section B: Handoff Analysis (75 words)**
Examine points where work transfers between parties:
- List all handoff points in your process
- Which handoffs cause delays or errors?
- What information gets lost or distorted at handoffs?
- How could handoffs be improved?

**Section C: Value Analysis (75 words)**
Categorize process steps:
- **Value-Added**: Steps that directly contribute to outputs customers care about
- **Business Value-Added**: Steps required for business reasons but don't add customer value (approvals, documentation)
- **Non-Value-Added**: Steps that add no value and could be eliminated (waiting, rework, unnecessary approvals)

**Section D: Improvement Opportunities (75 words)**
Propose specific improvements:
- Which inputs could be standardized or improved?
- What process steps could be eliminated, combined, or reordered?
- How could technology or tools improve efficiency?
- What would make the biggest positive impact?

### Deliverable 4: Process Metrics (150 words)

Define how to measure process performance:

**Current State Metrics:**
- **Cycle Time**: How long does the complete process take?
- **Quality**: What percentage of outputs meet requirements without rework?
- **Cost**: What resources (time, money, materials) does the process consume?
- **Customer Satisfaction**: How well does the process meet customer needs?

**Proposed Target Metrics:**
Based on your improvement opportunities, set realistic targets:
- Target cycle time reduction
- Quality improvement goals
- Resource savings opportunities
- Enhanced customer satisfaction

**Measurement Methods:**
- How would you collect this data?
- Who would be responsible for measurement?
- How frequently would you measure?

## Extension Activities

**For Advanced Students:**
- Create a detailed process flow diagram showing decision points and parallel activities
- Interview other process participants to validate your SIPOC analysis
- Research industry benchmarks for similar processes
- Develop a detailed implementation plan for your top improvement recommendation
- Create a dashboard mockup showing how you would track your proposed metrics

## Connection to Future Learning

This SIPOC analysis foundation prepares you for Chapter 0.3 (Process Mapping with BPMN), where you'll learn to create detailed visual representations of process flows. The improvement opportunities you identify here will be valuable when you learn Lean and Six Sigma concepts in Chapter 0.4.

Your experience analyzing a real process will make the theoretical concepts more meaningful and provide a practical foundation for advanced process improvement techniques.
