## Project Overview

You will develop a complete Process X-Ray methodology package that can be immediately deployed as a productized consulting offer. This project transforms the theoretical framework from Chapter 4.1 into a practical toolkit ready for client engagements.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Create a repeatable assessment methodology that delivers consistent quality results
- Develop professional templates and worksheets for efficient engagement delivery
- Design a pricing strategy with compelling value proposition positioning
- Build client-facing materials that position you as a strategic business advisor
- Establish quality assurance frameworks ensuring successful engagement outcomes

## Business Context

**Scenario: Building Your Signature Consulting Offer**

You are establishing your independent process consulting practice and need a signature assessment offer that serves multiple strategic purposes:

1. **Revenue Generation**: Immediate income from paid discovery engagements
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Eliminate unpaid discovery work while demonstrating capabilities
3. **Business Development**: Systematic approach to qualifying and converting prospects
4. **Market Positioning**: Establish expertise and credibility in process improvement
5. **Scalability Foundation**: Methodology that junior consultants can eventually deliver

Your Process X-Ray must be sophisticated enough to impress executives while being systematic enough for consistent delivery. The methodology should generate immediate value regardless of follow-on decisions while naturally positioning opportunities for larger transformation engagements.
