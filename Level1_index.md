# Level 1: Analysis & Design

**Advanced Process Analysis and Optimization Design**

Build on foundational knowledge to conduct thorough process analysis, identify bottlenecks, and design optimized workflows. This level focuses on stakeholder engagement and data-driven improvement strategies.

## Learning Objectives
By completing Level 1, you will:
- Conduct effective stakeholder interviews to gather process insights
- Map current-state (AS-IS) processes and identify bottlenecks
- Perform root-cause analysis and implement data capture strategies
- Design future-state (TO-BE) processes with defined KPIs
